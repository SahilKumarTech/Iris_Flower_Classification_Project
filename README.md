# Iris_Flower_Classification_Project

About the Project
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to accurately classify Iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — based on sepal and petal measurements.
The Iris dataset is one of the most popular datasets in the machine learning community, making it ideal for beginners to learn about classification tasks.

Project Objectives
Explore and visualize the Iris dataset.

Apply preprocessing and feature engineering techniques.

Build and evaluate multiple classification models.

Select the best-performing model for final predictions.

Technologies Used
Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

Google colab notebook 

Steps Followed
Data Exploration: Understanding the structure and distribution of data.

Preprocessing: Checking for missing values and preparing features.

Visualization: Plotting graphs to understand feature relationships.

Model Building: Training models like Logistic Regression .

Best Model Selection: Linear Regression : "with 97% accuracy"]

Results
Achieved a classification accuracy of 97 %.

Model successfully predicts the species of new, unseen Iris flowers.

Conclusion
This project provided hands-on experience in:

Handling a classification problem.

Performing model training, evaluation, and improvement.

Understanding the importance of model selection and tuning.
